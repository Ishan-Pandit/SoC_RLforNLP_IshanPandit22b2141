GitHub repository made for my SoC project: Reinforcement Learning for Natural Language Processing

## About the Project

This repository consists of the files which I have regarding the Summer of Code project I have undertaken:
Project ID 5 = RL for NLP

I found it a bit difficult to complete all requirements due to intern work as well as other project work. However, the mentors have done a great job and I am eager to complete the project before the endterm checkpoint successfully!
